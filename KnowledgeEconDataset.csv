To achieve high level of encryption, a 256 bit length key of Advance Encryption Standard is used to maximize protection and Diffie-Hellman algorithm to secure the processed key to both parties without interference from outside. In steganography, the encrypted image will be invisible into the cover image in which potential hackers do not have any idea about the original image embedded inside of the cover image, and with this even if the hacker got the image it will still need the correct key to decrypt it or else the image will be deleted The study used Rapid Application Development Model as the project development methodology, which allows the preceding phase to iterate until the application is refined, requirements are gathered and allows early testing of the prototypes during every iteration to reduce the risk of any major issues in the final deployment of the application. With the use of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Testing Standards, the application was evaluated in terms of its security, usability and reliability.

SARTORIO,BlockSight: A Mobile Image Encryption Using Advanced Encryption Standard and Least Significant Bit Algorithm,2016-2017,3,"In this paper, we developed a new mobile application designed to protect your images stored on your mobile phone using Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm to secure images by encrypting it and Least Significant Bit algorithm to process the encrypted image and embed it into another image. To achieve high level of encryption, a 256 bit length key of Advance Encryption Standard is used to maximize protection and Diffie-Hellman algorithm to secure the processed key to both parties without interference from outside. In steganography, the encrypted image will be invisible into the cover image in which potential hackers do not have any idea about the original image embedded inside of the cover image, and with this even if the hacker got the image it will still need the correct key to decrypt it or else the image will be deleted The study used Rapid Application Development Model as the project development methodology, which allows the preceding phase to iterate until the application is refined, requirements are gathered and allows early testing of the prototypes during every iteration to reduce the risk of any major issues in the final deployment of the application. With the use of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Testing Standards, the application was evaluated in terms of its security, usability and reliability.

ELLIZER MIKKO S. COLLANTES,Improving the Accuracy in Predicting Basketball Results Using Cascading Algorithm,2016-2017,3,"Anybody can guess the winners of a basket game. The question is how big the chances are in predicting the real winners. Relying only on the experts' experiences and intuition could not discover all the value and potential of the collected data. Driven by the increasing comprehensive data in sports datasets and data mining technique successfully used in different areas, sports data mining technique emerges and enables us to find hidden knowledge to impact the sports industry. A more scientific approach is needed to use for these data that are collected. Some predictors based only on winning records and some based only on statistical records of both teams. There are also predictors which use both types of data, but the accuracy of applying different individual algorithms is only ranging about 60% - 70%. To achieve better prediction rates and deal with that complexity, a lot of machine learning methods have been implemented over these data. This paper presents an improved technique for predicting basketball game results implementing cascading algorithm. The researchers combined Naive Bayes, Four Factor Analysis, and Fuzzy Logic Algorithms to predict basketball game result in an acceptable level of 69% - 70% accuracy. The researchers tested several times using data sets from NBA game Season 2015-2016, and the cascading algorithm result manages to reach 70% prediction accuracy. The result of this system can be used to assist basketball coaches in making plans for possible team developments.

Despite the government's efforts to combat cyber trafficking, the growing number of cases is alarming. One apparent reason is that traffickers keep advancing their technical strategies, so it becomes more challenging for law enforcement to investigate complex and transnational organized crime. Thus, this paper presents the development of a cyber monitoring and trafficking web application integrated with a web scraper that identifies websites with a high probability of being used in cyber trafficking activities. The web scraper was written using Beautiful Soup. With the result of the sensitivity analysis conducted in the study, beautiful soup was determined to be the most suitable tool for developing web scraping algorithms based on performance, portability, and accuracy compared with the Scrapy and Selenium tools.

ROSELIA C. MORCO,Development of Virtual Support Application for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Victims,2022,1,"Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) is an issue of a serious global concern. SGBV affects everyone and has severe implications on an individual's physical, mental, emotional, and sexual health. Cases of Sexual and Gender-based violence (SGBV) rise especially during pandemic. There was an increased domestic violence due to women being trapped with a perpetrator, often without the means of accessing support (Wendoh, 2020). Due to heightened restrictions to leave homes, many victims have limited means to seek social and professional care and support. Moreover, government and non-government services could not also prioritize their SGBV responses due to lockdown. Thus, this study aimed to develop a Virtual Support Web Application that would inform and guide victims using SGBV -related educational materials and aid victims in reaching out to organizations and law enforcement agencies for help and assistance. The proposed application is a digital-enabled multifunctional SGBV response tool called TARA. It also utilizes web analytics to create data maps on SGBV and intends to assist by providing access to Self-Care and Psycho-Social Services. TARA aims to become the key instrument for raising awareness, providing a directory and direction to law enforcement agencies to deal with new and future SGBV cases.

A valid and reliable test  item is a must to ensure that the students are given a fair assessment. Testing the validity and reliability of an examination requires a thorough process.  In this paper, there are six processes involved in Item Analysis Table of Specification (TOS) Creation, Test Item Preparation using LANSchool Classroom  Management Software (LCMS). Test Administration and Scores Generation, Test Item Analysis using test item analyzer (TIA) prototype, Test Item  Modification, and New Examination Administration. TIA automatically generates the number of items to be included in the examination based on course  learning objectives and total time in minutes a lesson was taught in class. Teachers prepare test items of varying difficulties that cover both lower-order  thinking skills (LOTS) and higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). The simulation result shows 64 items or 32% were incorrectly answered while 136 or 68%  were correctly answered. There is an anomaly on Item 7 and 8 in terms of point-biserial Correlation (Rpbi) and p-values (P) hence should be removed  or revised. Those correctly answered items are moderately difficult and should be retained. TIA prototype embedded with LCMS addresses the gap in  related works in terms of test construction, paperless examination, test-item analysis and test bank of valid and reliable test items. TIA could aid in the  attainment of course learning objectives which could serve as an ancillary for the evaluation of both student and teacher performances.","classroom management software, examination validity, point-biserial correlation, p-values, table of specification, test item reliability",Test-Item-Analyzer-Using-Point-biserial-Correlation-And-P-values.pdf (ijstr.org)

ROSMINA JOY M. CABAUATAN,Query Optimization: Fund Data Generation Applying NonClustered Indexing and MapReduced Data Cube Numerosity Reduction Method,2020,3,"Nowadays, data aggregation is becoming the concern of the  financial institution because this is very useful to answer the  series of data over the years and at present. Big data is described as a large set of data at a different level that becomes a concern to which it is difficult to manage. It is a problem for  most businesses to achieve better query performance while  generating and analyzing large data by way of, data  aggregation and such an exponential increase of data size  makes a query to take a large amount of time and space. The  data cube is a widely used tool to provide an efficient way to  compute the data into a small data set. In this paper, the query  optimization technique is to address the prolonged execution  of the query by applying one of the data reduction strategies  called numerosity reduction methods; slice and dice data cube  operation is to reduce and efficiently aggregate yet maintains  the accuracy of the data. The nonclustered index is to quickly  retrieve the data without scanning the whole fact table and  very useful for some repeated values. MapReduce based  approach is for handling large scale data, in which it is of  great help to enhance the data cube computation and achieve  optimal time over large data set. The technique improves the  response time by an average of 94%, and the availability of  the memory space becomes 91%. With this, a timely increase  in query performance could mean better use of data in  operation and timely decision making for management.","NonClustered Index and MR Data Cube Computation, Numerosity Reduction Method, Query Optimization, MapReduce based approach",ijatcse19911sl2020.pdf (warse.org)
JOHN JOEL MARTINEZ,Day-Ahead Solar Irradiation Forecasting Utilizing Gramian Angular Field and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory,2020,3,"The operations of power systems are becoming more challenging on account of the high penetration of renewable power generation, including photovoltaic systems. One method for improving the power system operation involves making accurate forecasts of day-ahead solar irradiation, enabling operators to minimize uncertainty in managing the balance between generation and load. To overcome the limitations of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) in a one-dimensional forecasting problem, this work proposes a novel method in forecasting solar irradiation by encoding time-series data into images using the Gramian Angular Field and the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network. The pre-processed data become a five-dimensional input tensor that is perfectly suitable for ConvLSTM. The ConvLSTM network uses convolution operations in its input-to-state transition and state-to-state transition. The network thus enables time-series forecasting by a feature-rich approach, which ultimately provides competitive forecasting performance despite the use of a small dataset. The proposed method was evaluated in day-ahead solar irradiation forecasting using a univariate dataset of Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) data from Fuhai in Taiwan. The proposed method was resampled using 5×2-fold cross-validation, and assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine the statistical significance of the result. It outperformed benchmark methods such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Convolutional Neural Network cascaded with Long Short-term Memory (CNN-LSTM), and LSTM cascaded with a fully-connected (FC) network","forecasting, radiation effects, logic gates, training, power generation, graphics processing units, weather forecasting",Day-Ahead Solar Irradiation Forecasting Utilizing Gramian Angular Field and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE Xplore

JUNNEL E. AVESTRO,Hybrid Algorithm Combining Modified Diffie Hellman and RSA,2019,3,"The Classic Diffie-Hellman (CDH) algorithm encounters several security problems. The algorithm security depends on the complexity of solving the discrete logarithm and the integer factorization problem. The security also depends on the length of bits keys used. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid algorithm, the combination of Modified Diffie Hellman (MDH) with the Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) algorithm. The MDH will not use primitive root (g). Instead, it will use two prime numbers (P and Q) for key exchange. It reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. Furthermore, the MDH has an authentication mechanism. If both shared keys are equal, the communication will continue. Otherwise, it will stop because it is compromised. Also, the RSA algorithm will use the two prime numbers generated by MDH (P and Q). The RSA algorithm will perform the encryption and decryption message. The Diffie Hellman (DH) and the RSA Algorithms are the basis of several security standards and services on the internet, especially TLS and SSL.

FREDILYN CALANDA,A modified least significant bit randomized embedding method based on image partitioning and columnar transposition with encryption,2019,3,"While traditional embedding methods which are usually based on LSBs provide security to hidden messages in image-based Steganography, steganalyses have shown these methods to be vulnerable to detection and extraction, thus compromising the security of embedded messages. In this study, a new embedding method based on LSB is introduced to address this vulnerability. By using a one-time pad encryption method, the security of secret messages before embedding is ensured. A partitioning method based on columnar transposition and RGB color plane scattering technique is employed to improve scattering and ensure randomization during embedding. The experimental result shows an excellent outcome of the Peak-signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean square Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity (SSIM) index. The PSNR value of the 5 test images results ranges from 53.2122 to 60.8716 all are higher than the acceptable value of PSNR, which is 30db.The average MSE result is0.2766 for all color planes, which also provide an outstanding result since the lower the MSE means the accumulative squared error between the stego image and the original one is lower. The average SSIM obtained in the testing is 0.9792for the 5 test images, which is very close to 1. The result supports the claim that the resulting stego images have low distortion which means that the cover image is almost the same with the stego image and that the modified LSB embedding algorithm provides excellent image quality with high imperceptibility and provides added security layers.

VILLANUEVA,Mobile-based Translation System for Cebuano Language with Object Detection for Travel Assistance Using Neural Machine Translation,2019,3,"The Philippines as an archipelagic nation has the numerous number of dialects per island that hampers local tourist communication. Cebu is one of the top tourist destinations by locals also has a vast language hurdle compared to other local dialects. Because of huge language differences of native Cebuano and Filipino speakers, travelers in Cebu often experience difficulty in expressing their needs and requests to the island locals. The solution is a mobile-based translation system with object detection for travel assistance. The system uses Neural Machine Translation to translate Filipino to Cebuano language and vice versa based on the user's keyboard input, extracted text strings from a detected image, and the detected object itself. The Filipino-Cebuano model obtained 31.1 BLEU score, while the Cebuano-Filipino model obtained 31.6 BLEU score.","keyboards, object detection, urban areas, training, feature extraction, data models",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8938565
CRIS PAULO HATE,Unconstrained Ear Recognition through Domain Adaptive Deep Learning Models of Convolutional Neural Network,2019,3,"Limited ear dataset yields to the adaption of domain adaptive deep learning or transfer learning in the development of ear biometric recognition. Ear recognition is a variation of biometrics that is becoming popular in various areas of research due to the advantages of ears towards human identity recognition. In this paper, handpicked CNN architectures: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, Inception-ResNet-v2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet-v2 are explored and compared for use in an unconstrained ear biometric recognition. 250 unconstrained ear images are collected and acquired from the web through web crawlers and are preprocessed with basic image processing methods including the use of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization for ear image quality improvement. Each CNN architecture is analyzed structurally and are fine-tuned to satisfy the requirements of ear recognition. Earlier layers of CNN architectures are used as feature extractors. Last 2-3 layers of each CNN architectures are fine-tuned thus, are replaced with layers of the same kind for ear recognition models to classify 10 classes of ears instead of 1000. 80 percent of acquired unconstrained ear images is used for training and the remaining 20 percent is reserved for testing and validation. Results of each architectures are compared in terms of their training time, training and validation outputs as such learned features and losses, and test results in terms of above-95% accuracy confidence. Above all the used architectures, ResNet, AlexNet, and GoogleNet achieved an accuracy confidence of 97-100% and is best for use in unconstrained ear biometric recognition while ShuffleNet, despite of achieving approximately 90%, shows promising result for use in mobile version of unconstrained ear biometric recognition.","ear recognition, domain adaptive deep learning, convolutional neural network, transfer learning",(PDF) Unconstrained Ear Recognition through Domain Adaptive Deep Learning Models of Convolutional Neural Network (researchgate.net)

GERALD CAYABYAB,Interactive Growcut Multi-Label N-D Segmentation Based Algorithm for SCLERA Segmentation,2018,3,"This paper presents a computationally efficient sclera detection, segmentation, and enhancement approach. The proposed sclera detection and segmentation approach is developed based on the cellular automaton which evolves using the Grow-Cut algorithm and enhancement approach based on Multiscale Retinex. The major advantage of the developed approach is its computational simplicity, speed, and accuracy as compared to the prior detection, segmentation, and enhancement approaches developed for sclera segmentation images. The new used approach was tested in Intel i5 4570 with 3.2 GHz processor and 16GB RAM and Intel Dual Core with 2.48 GHz processor and with 2GB RAM. Using these two different units, the result shows that segmentation under Intel i5 segment sclera for three hours with an image size of 640x480 pixels while in Intel Dual Core 2GB RAM having the same image size segments the sclera for fourteen hours and eighteen minutes. The experimental results obtained from ND-IRIS 0405 database and publicly available images and respectively achieved better performance in terms of computational simplicity, speed, and accuracy as compared to the previous proposed method. Multiscale Retinex enhanced image very fast with a highest minimum execution time of seventeen seconds (17secs) for an image size of 640 x 480 pixels for both color and grayscale. The proposed approach for enhancement shows better performance in enhancing low contrast, dark with poor illumination images but color rendition is quite poor for images having good illumination. The experimental results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate the applicability of the proposed sclera detection, segmentation, and enhancement approach, i.e., significant reduction in computational complexity in detection segmentation and enhancement while providing comparable segmentation and enhancement performance.

The system uses a multi-scale training that varies between sizes and recognizable patterns. Training of the single neural network upon detection and classification of a target varies depending upon the computer specifications. Being a classified as a simple expert system, it may less likely predict false positive results if objects are not pre-trained, but through proper intensive training and more image inputs it can predict objects in a more precise classification.

ALIMUIN,Implementation of machine vision as an input to a fuzzy water level control system,2017,3,"In this paper, a Type I fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is applied to execute machine vision parameters such as object tracking and image processing on a specific color threshold. This system is used to compensate for large power consumption of current PID controllers that are currently being used in industrial tank systems. The aim of the implemented fuzzy controller is to utilize the conventional camera to replace existing level sensors and linear variable differential transformers (LVDT) in monitoring the water level inside a reservoir under a definite tolerance. The camera is integrated in a Roborealm machine vision software which analyses the input parameter. An embedded Arduino microcontroller handles the regulation pump which maintains the specified water level onto user defined conditions. It is found out that the fuzzy system produced a better solution than conventional control techniques.","machine vision, fuzzy logic, microcontrollers, pumps, software, cameras, computer vision, solenoid valve, roborealm",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8269484
GERALD T. CAYABYAB,Covisance: A Real Time Mobile Recolorization Tool for Aiding Color Vision Deficient Users Utilizing D-15 Color Arrangement Test,2017,3,"In this paper, we developed a new mobile application designed to serve as a color vision enhancement tool for individuals with color vision deficiency, or commonly known as color blindness. A person who suffers from Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) faces many complexities in everyday life in even the simplest activities due to having a narrower color spectrum which caused them to perceive colors with similar shades and intensity. Hence, to address this problem, a color vision enhancement method using LMS Daltonization Algorithm was utilized to transform or convert the color of images into a clearer and more recognizable colors to differentiate the colors of two unrelated areas. The application was also designed for a real-time image color processing function that minimizes color discrimination by changing the color for better representation. The application also provided an assessment to identify the user's colorblindness type using D-15 Color Arrangement Test. To validate the accuracy and correctness of information, selected doctors of Optometry and CVD users evaluated the mobile application.","Mobile Application, Color Vision, Deficiency, Farnsworth D-15 CVD Test, LMS Daltonization Algorithm, Image Coor Processing",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3168390.3168432

CRIS PAULO HATE,Weighted Adaptive Multi-parameter Edge Evaluation (WAMEE) Metric for MANET-type Topologies using a Genetic Path Finding Algorithm,2017,3,"A novel approach in the formulation of a metric for Mobile AdHoc Networks (MANET) is developed. The constant movement, the appearance of new nodes, and the disappearance of pre-existing routes have negative effects on the network, therefore, routing metrics of wired systems may not be the most effective methods of measurement for the wireless systems. If the classiical methods are utilized by the MANETs, ineffectivity may ensue due to the heavily dynamic nature of its nodes. This papre introduces a new metric called Weigthed Adaptive Multi-parameter Edge Evaluation (WAMEE) which evaluates multiple metrics, both used by wire and wireless networks. This new metric is to be applied to a Genetic Path Search Algorithm. Results show that a comparable result in the route selection process is present between the classic approach and this alternate method.","MANET, metric, routing, spf, ga, optimization",(PDF) Weighted Adaptive Multi-parameter Edge Evaluation (WAMEE) Metric for MANET-Type Topologies using Genetic Path Finding Algorithm (researchgate.net)

Coded coefficients of significant predictors facilitated the calculation of log of odds attributed to each group of users and formulation of logistic regression equations. Converted from the results are executed probabilities used for obtaining distinct group memberships. The classification rate obtained from cross-tabulated counts and percentages confirmed the capability of the model. With accurate predictions, the models could provide decision makers a better understanding of individual interactions and group-level behaviors of subscribers, a tipoff for improvement of Short Message Service (SMS) schemes to positively leverage service usage to generate more profit while extending customer satisfaction.","supervised learning, logistic regression, probabilities, classification, data mining, bootstrapping",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3055635.3056615

JEAN ANGELES,AR Plants: Herbal Plant Mobile Application Utilizing Augmented Reality,2017,3,"This paper intends to introduce a mobile application that provides information about herbal plants commonly found in the Philippines utilizing augmented reality. All information about herbal plants were provided by the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) including its characteristics, scientific names, vitamin content, uses, where to find it and procedure how to use it. For the development of the mobile application, we used Unity software and Vuforia SDK as it may provide many resources such as image converter, camera, tracker, video background renderer, application code, user-defined targets, and device databases. We also used the Vuforia QCAR algorithm that can identify the tracking points of the image target from the database and will be used for augmentation of 3D models. In evaluating the acceptability of AR Plants mobile application, a 5-point Likert-scaled questionnaire was designed and validated by IT experts. With the total average mean of 4.29, it shows that the mobile application is acceptable in terms suitability, accurateness, learnability, operability, time behavior, resource utilization, and recovery. With the use of multimedia content and AR technology, it can help the user to become aware, engage, and enhance his vision with useful information about the surrounding environment. For future works, we recommend to add additional kinds of herbal plants, provide a cloud database and to use a better algorithm for identifying real-life targets.","Mobile application, augmented reality, object recognition, herbal plants ",AR-Plants-Herbal-Plant-Mobile-Application-utilizing-Augmented-Reality.pdf (researchgate.net)

The question is how big the chances are in predicting the real winners. Relying only on the experts' experiences and intuition could not discover all the value and potential of the collected data. Driven by the increasing comprehensive data in sports datasets and data mining technique successfully used in different areas, sports data mining technique emerges and enables us to find hidden knowledge to impact the sports industry. A more scientific approach is needed to use for these data that are collected. Some predictors based only on winning records and some based only on statistical records of both teams. There are also predictors which use both types of data, but the accuracy of applying different individual algorithms is only ranging about 60% - 70%. To achieve better prediction rates and deal with that complexity, a lot of machine learning methods have been implemented over these data. This paper presents an improved technique for predicting basketball game results implementing cascading algorithm. The researchers combined Naive Bayes, Four Factor Analysis, and Fuzzy Logic Algorithms to predict basketball game result in an acceptable level of 69% - 70% accuracy. The researchers tested several times using data sets from NBA game Season 2015-2016, and the cascading algorithm result manages to reach 70% prediction accuracy.

In this paper, a bootstrapped partition of a full dataset has been used to gauge the ability of polytomous logistic regression models in predicting classifications of telecommunication subscribers. Coded coefficients of significant predictors facilitated the calculation of log of odds attributed to each group of users and formulation of logistic regression equations. Converted from the results are executed probabilities used for obtaining distinct group memberships. The classification rate obtained from cross-tabulated counts and percentages confirmed the capability of the model. With accurate predictions, the models could provide decision makers a better understanding of individual interactions and group-level behaviors of subscribers, a tipoff for improvement of Short Message Service (SMS) schemes to positively leverage service usage to generate more profit while extending customer satisfaction.","supervised learning, bootstrapping, classifications, probabilities, logistic regression, data mining",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3055635.3056615
